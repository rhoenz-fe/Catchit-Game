Unless it's just my computer, it does take a bit to start up but please give it a few minutes to load!

The point of the game is collecting rain drops!
One by one a "rain drop" (a small blue square) falls from the top of the window where a "cloud" appears.
You are able to control the bucket at the bottom of the window to catch that drop, but you can only go left and right using the arrow keys.
The game ends when you catch 15 rain drops! The amount you've caught is shown on the upper right corner of the window and you also get a splash indicator whenever you catch one. 

Be careful!
The more drops you catch, the faster they will drop.
That's not the only thing that'll be dropping fast too. There will be random chances of a brick falling from the sky.
If you get hit by one of them,  it is game over!

I hope you have fun!
